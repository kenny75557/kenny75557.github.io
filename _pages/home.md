Hi, I'm Yenhsiang Wang (王彥翔). Research Assitant at the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://nlpnchu.org/) at National Chung Hsing University, advised by  Professor [Yao-Chang Fan](https://yfan.nlpnchu.org/). 


My recent research and projects are as follows include Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,

- Investigating Extremely Low Resource Understanding on LLM for Indigenous Language translation.
- Distractor Set Generation (For Multiple-choice question) via Reinforcement Learning.
- Researching on Passage Retrieval for legal and agricultural domain Question-Answering. [Shennong-TAIDE](https://demetergptv2.nlpnchu.org/index.html)

Currently seeking opportunities as a PhD candidate and planning to apply for programs commencing in 2025.


## Research Interests
* Retrieval Method and Large Language Models.
* Applications of Reinforcement learning from human feedback, Algorithm for Training Reward Model.
