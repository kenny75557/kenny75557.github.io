Hi, I'm Yenhsiang Wang (王彥翔). I earned my master's degree from the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://nlpnchu.org/) at National Chung Hsing University, advised by  Professor [Yao-Chang Fan](https://yfan.nlpnchu.org/). 

I am primarily interested in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, especially in the following topics:
- Information Retrieval with LMs: Training methodologies for retrieval models and system architectures for Open Domain Question-Answering (QA).
- Chain of Thought (Cot)
- Factuality and Hallucination in Large Language Model

After completing a year of military service and working in the industry for a period of time, I am currently exploring opportunities as a Ph.D. candidate. I plan to apply for programs starting in 2025.
