Hi, I'm Yenhsiang Wang (王彥翔). Currently as Research Assitant at the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://nlpnchu.org/) at National Chung Hsing University. My master's research is advised by Professor [Yao-Chang Fan](https://yfan.nlpnchu.org/). 

My recent research and projects are as follows include Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, including but not limited to:

- Exploring how LLMs can enhance translation for Indigenous languages ​​by leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning by giving relevant patterns by sentence retrieval.
- Researching on the performance of Sparse embedding, Dense embedding, and LLM query expansion in specific domain retrieval.

Currently seeking for PhD opportunities starting from 2025 Fall.

## Research Interests
* Reliable and robust integration of effective retrievers and large language models.
* Interpretability on Large Language Models.

I am interested in enhancing the interpretability of model mechanisms and their understanding of human intentions, as well as in providing more accurate and reliable retrieval methods for Large Language Models.
